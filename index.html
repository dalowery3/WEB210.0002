            <h3>Vicious Cycles</h3>
            <p>During my first semester, I took WEB140: Web Development Tools. For my final project, we had to design a website based on a fake business called 'Vicious Cycles'.</p>
            <p>First, we created a sitemap to layout the pages for the site we're creating. Then, we crafted a design brief for a pretend client. Once it was approved by our professor, we went on to design our website. (Disclaimer: Each student had to craft their own site. With that being said, this site was designed by Drucilla and only Drucilla.)</p>

            <h3>Mental Health Awareness Bonfire| Torch the Night</h3>
            <p>Also during my first semester, I took WEB110: Internet/ Web Fundamentals. For my final project, we had to design a landing page based on an event of our choice.</p>
            <p>Along with designing a landing page, we had to also create a sign-up and confirmation page, and link all three pages together with the click of a button. (Disclaimer: Each student had to craft their own site. With that being said, this site was designed by Drucilla and only Drucilla.)</p>
